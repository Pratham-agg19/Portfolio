# Profile Photo Setup Instructions

## How to Add Your Profile Photo

1. **Save your photo** as `profile-photo.jpg` in the portfolio-website folder
2. **Recommended specifications:**
   - Format: JPG or JPEG
   - Size: 300x300 pixels or larger (will be automatically resized)
   - File name: `profile-photo.jpg`
   - File size: Under 2MB for faster loading

3. **Place the file** in the same folder as `index.html`

## File Structure Should Look Like:
```
portfolio-website/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
├── script.js
├── README.md
├── profile-photo.jpg  ← Add your photo here
└── resume.pdf
```

## Alternative Options:
- If you prefer a different filename, update the `src` attribute in `index.html` line 67
- If you prefer PNG format, save as `profile-photo.png` and update the HTML accordingly

## Testing:
After adding your photo, refresh the browser to see your profile picture in the About section.
